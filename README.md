A collection of plugins-turned-modules, QoL improvements, and Automation features.

## Includes
### 🔑 AutoLogin:
VIWI - AutoLogin is an Anti-DDoS module that will store the details of your last-known active character and attempt to automatically reconnect to them in the event of a sudden disconnect.

Additionally, AutoLogin prevents your client from killing itself on any lobby/disconnection errors, and offers client launching functionality during detected AuthenticationErrors/Expired Auth Tokens.

### 🛠️ Workshoppa:
Workshoppa is a workshop project manager and automator originally created by Liza, now completely rewritten using ECommons and fully integrated into VIWI.
Workshoppa allows you to queue multiple company projects and automatically turn in the required materials to progress each project to its next stage.
Additionally, Workshoppa includes features for automatically purchasing Grade 6 Dark Matter for repair kits, as well as recursively purchasing ceruleum fuel tanks from the FC mammet.

⛏️ Grindstone (working title) is an addition to Workshoppa classic that allows you to quickly level miners via workshop crafting projects.
This feature makes use of Mudstones, purchasable from Residential District Material Suppliers, and only requires you to be at least level 20 MIN to start.
